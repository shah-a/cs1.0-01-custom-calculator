This is a simple calculation program. The scenario is a person floating in the sky, holding a giant helium balloon. The user is asked to input flight duration and distance travelled, then speed is calculated by the speed formula: **speed = distance/time**

Calculator assumes:
(1) An ideal physics world (i.e. no air resistance, etc)
(2) Flight took place at constant speed.
